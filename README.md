# Scheme program to approximate the value of Pi

- If you have a circle, you can measure two things:
the distance around the perimeter of the circle (circumference)
and the distance across the widest part of the circle (diameter).
No matter how big your circle, the ratio of circumference to diameter is the value of Pi.
Based on this I created a scheme program that calculates pi. 

- It concists of 4 steps:1)  distance-to-origin procedure, 2)make-points procedure, 3) count-in-circle procedure, 4) calculate-pi procedure                          
- `car` and `cons`operations been used to split the lists
-  All three functions created in steps 1, 2, 3 are used in step for to approximate the value of pi.
-  The ratio created by 4th procedure approximates the value of pi.
